## ⚠️ Next Steps Required

Your NestJS server is still running and locking the Prisma Client files. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Stop the Server

In the terminal where your server is running (showing "Application is running on: http://[::1]:3008"):

```
Press Ctrl + C
```

### Step 2: Regenerate Prisma Client

```powershell
npx prisma generate
```

### Step 3: Restart Your Server

```powershell
npm run start:dev
```

## 🧪 Test Your Checkout API

Once the server restarts, test the checkout:

```bash
POST http://localhost:3008/orders/checkout
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "user": {
    "name": "Ashraful Islam",
    "phone": "01750514197",
    "email": "ashrafulislamsay7@gmail.com",
    "address": "I Block",
    "deliveryArea": "Inside Dhaka"
  },
  "products": [
    {
      "id": 22,
      "name": "Rizz-bifold wallet",
      "price": 250,
      "originalPrice": 500,

    }
  ],
  "total": 250,
  "deliveryCharge": 80,
  "totalPayableAmount": 330
}
```
